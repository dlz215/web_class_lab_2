<h1>Some of my favorite things</h1>

<h2>Favorite TV Series</h2>

<p>My favorite TV series is <i>Twin Peaks</i>, a mystery/horror series created by David Lynch and
    Mark Frost. The original run consisted of two seasons that aired in 1990-1991. A 3rd season
    was aired in 2017. The series is known for mixing elements of the detective and soap opera genres
    with the dark, surreal, and complex storytelling methods of its directors.</p>

<h2>Favorite Music</h2>

<p>My favorite musical act is <b>Deathspell Omega</b>, a French black metal band that formed in
    1998 and is currently active. After starting with a traditional black metal style influenced
    by the Scandinavian scene of the early 90s, they gained more notoriety and acclaim after taking
    their sound in a more experimental direction.</p>
